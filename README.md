# focusstack-gui
Unofficial graphical interface for the Focus-stack CLI tool.  This project provides a clean and structured PyQt6-based graphical interface for controlling the Focus-stack AppImage version with full exposure of CLI options.  It does not modify or repackage Focus-stack.   It acts as a frontend wrapper around the official CLI executable.
